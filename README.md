# Discount Scraper
This is a small project to scrap all the discounts that helps myself and other students save up a little.
Currently only website it scraps from is the UofT store website.
Will add more websties in Toronto, and more cities in the future.

This project was also meant for me to learn a bit of web scraping with bs4.
Please let me know, or open a PR if there could be improvements.
